### Not planned (feature out of scope)

Thanks for the proposal. This could be useful, but this project is in
selective maintenance mode and maintainers are not taking on new feature
development right now.

Given current scope/capacity, we're closing as **not planned**.

If you'd like to contribute this, we're open to reviewing a focused PR with
tests and a clear long-term maintenance story.

### Not planned (compatibility cost too high)

Thanks for the report. We confirmed this compatibility gap, but addressing it
would require substantial refactoring and ongoing maintenance beyond current
project scope/capacity.

For that reason, we're closing as **not planned**.

If someone wants to propose a minimal, low-risk patch with tests, we can reconsider.

### Needs contributor follow-through

Thanks -- we're open to this direction, but we can't prioritize implementation
right now.

Marking this as **help wanted**. A PR is welcome.

### Stale / inactive

This issue has had no activity for an extended period. Closing for now to keep
the tracker focused.

If this is still relevant, feel free to reopen with updated context or a linked PR.
