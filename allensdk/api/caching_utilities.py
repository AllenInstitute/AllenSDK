    Parameters
    ----------
    fetch :
        Function which pulls data from a remote/expensive source.
    write : 
        Function which stores data in a local/inexpensive store.
    read :
        Function which pulls data from a local/inexpensive store.
    pre_write :
        Function applied to obtained data after fetching, but before writing.
    cleanup :
        Function for fixing a failed fetch. e.g. unlinking a partially 
        downloaded file. Exceptions raised by cleanup are not themselves 
        handled
    lazy :
        If True, attempt to read the data from the local/inexpensive store 
        before fetching it. If False, forcibly fetch from the 
        remote/expensive store.
    num_tries :
        How many fetches to attempt before (re)raising an exception. A fetch 
        is failed if reading the result raises an exception.
    failure_message :
        Provides additional context in the event of a failed download. Emitted 
        when retrying, and when a fetch failure occurs after tries are 
        exhausted

    Returns
    -------
    The result of calling read
