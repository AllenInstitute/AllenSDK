    Returns
    -------
    start_frames: List[int]
        The global index of the starting frames associated with the

    Notes
    -----
    Ideally, the vsync_stim line in the sync file represents when
    frames from a stimulus are presented to the mouse. Unfortunately,
    they do not carry any information about which stimulus block
    the frames correspond to (behavior, mapping, or replay in a fiducial
    VBN session). The stim_running line, however, can be used to find
    the dividing times between the three stimulus presentations.
    stim_running is high when a stimulus block is being presented
    and low when it is not. What this method does is:

    1) Take a list of raw frame times as input (probably the falling
    edges of the vsync_stim line, but possibly the rising edges,
    depending on our use case)

    2) Find the timestamps associated with the rising and falling
    edges of stim_running. These are taken to be the breaks between
    stimulus blocks.

    3) Divide the raw frame times into blocks that fall between the
    stimulus block start/end times from (2).

    4) Try to match the blocks of frame times against the expected
    number of frames in each block as specified in stimulus_frame_counts.

    http://confluence.corp.alleninstitute.org/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=IT&title=Addressing+variable+monitor+lag+in+sync+data+for+Visual+Behavior+Neuropixels

    This is a modified copy of a method originally implemented in
    ecephys_etl_pipelines/.../vbn_create_stimulus_table/create_stim_table.py
    The purpose of the modified copy is to allow us to use rising *or* falling
    edges as raw_stim_times, depending on the use case.
