Current Source Density
======================
Computes the current source density for one or more probes


Running
-------
You can run this module from an input json:
```
python -m allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.current_source_density --input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
If you are on the Allen Institute's network, you can also run the module from information in our LIMS:
```
python -m allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.current_source_density --source lims --session_id <id of an ecephys_session> --output_root <path to output data directory> --output_json <path to output json>
```


Input data
----------
This module takes in an array of LFP samples and their associated timestamps for each probe. The CSD is calculated for some window in time around the onset of a stimulus. The window, as well as the stimulus, need to be specified. The stimulus table is required in order to determine when these stimulus onsets occured. See the schema file for detailed information on the module inputs.


Processing steps
----------------

For each neuropixels probe, the following steps are performed to compute CSD
for a window in time around stimuli onset:

1) Trial events are analyzed to create an array of timestamps surrounding stimuli onset.

2) LFP data is loaded.

3) Temporal slices of LFP data are extracted for times surrounding stimuli onset. (Using time windows from step 1.)

4) Reference and noisy probe channels are removed from temporally sliced LFP data.

5) Each remaining channel in LFP data is bandpass filtered.

6) Cleaned and filtered LFP data is interpolated to new virtual locations along
the center of the probe to account for the staggered physical layout
of real channels.

7) LFP data is averaged across trials.

8) CSD is calculated using the numerical approximation to the Laplacian, after Pitts (1952).


Output data
-----------
- a (channels X samples) npy file containing CSD data
- a 1D npy file defining sample timestamps in seconds relative to stimulus onset 
- in the output json, an array of channel ids identifying the channels at each row in the csd data file
