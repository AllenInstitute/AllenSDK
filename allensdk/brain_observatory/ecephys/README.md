Extracellular Electrophysiology
===============================

At the Allen Institute for Brain Science we collect **e**xtra**c**ellular **e**lectro**phys**iology (abbreviated as **ecephys**) data using [Neuropixels probes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24636). The primary data consists of spike times recorded from individual units, as well as continuous local field potential (LFP) signals recorded from individual electrodes. Each data point is spatially registered to a  location along the Neuropixels probe shank and (in most cases) a specific 3D point in the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3). These datasets are incredibly rich, and can be used to address a variety of scientific questions related to visual physiology, inter-area interactions, and state-dependent signal processing.

This subpackage of the AllenSDK contains:

- code for accessing and working with our ecephys data
- code for data pre-processing and [NWB file](https://www.nwb.org/how-to-use/) packaging
- code for analyzing these data in our pipelines


Python compatibility
--------------------
The code in this subpackage is guaranteed to be compatible with Python versions 3.6 and later. It is not compatible with Python 2.
