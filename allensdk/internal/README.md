Internal
========

This subpackage contains code that depends on Allen Institute for Brain Science-specific resources, such as tools for accessing our internal databases. The code here should only be expected to run if you are at the Allen Institute!

The dependencies specific to this subpackage are listed in internal_requirements.txt. There are some of additional dependencies with complicated installation requirements that we don't list in internal_requirements.txt. These are:
- neuron : we build this from source by:
    ```
    ./configure --without-iv --prefix={install location} --with-nrnpython={path to your python}
    make
    make install
    ```
- mpi4py : we conda install this like `conda install mpi4py`
- opencv : we conda install this like `conda install -c conda-forge opencv`

Accessing Databases
===================
If you want to access the on-prem databases using the AllenSDK without providing credentials every time,
you'll need to export the following environment variables. We recommend adding the following
to your ~/.bash_profile on Linux or macOS machines (empty quotes are strings you need to fill in):

If you do not know the credentials and need access, contact [Rob Young](RobY@alleninstitute.org) or [Wayne Wakeman](waynew@alleninstitute.org).

```
export LIMS_DBNAME="lims2"
export LIMS_USER=""
export LIMS_HOST=""
export LIMS_PORT=5432
export LIMS_PASSWORD=""
export MTRAIN_DBNAME="mtrain"
export MTRAIN_USER=""
export MTRAIN_HOST=""
export MTRAIN_PORT=5432
export MTRAIN_PASSWORD=""
```

After completing your bash profile, run the following command:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

or close and reopen your terminal.
