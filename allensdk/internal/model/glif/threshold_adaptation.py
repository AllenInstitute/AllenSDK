    '''Calculate the spike components of the threshold by fitting a decaying exponential function to data to threshold versus time 
    since last spike in the multiblip data. The exponential is forced to decay to the local th_inf (calculated as the mean all of the 
    threshold values of the first spikes in each individual triblip stimulus).  For each multiblip stimulus in a stimulus set if there
    is more than one spike the difference in voltages from the first and second spike are plotted versus the separation in time.  Note that 
    this algorithm should only be implemented on multiblips sweeps where the neuron spike on the first and second blip.  Since there is 
    no easy way to do this, this erroneous data should not be provided to this algorithm (i.e is should be visually checked and eliminated 
    the preprocessor should hold back this data manually for now.)  
    
    #TODO: check to see if this is still true. Notes: The standard SDK spike detection algorithm does not work with the multiblip stimulus 
    due to artifacts when the stimulus turns on and off. Please see the find_multiblip_spikes module for more information.

    This function returns the squared error for the difference between the 'known' voltage
    component of the threshold obtained from the biological neuron and the voltage component 
    of the threshold of the model obtained with the input parameters (so that the minimum can be 
    searched for via fmin). The overall threshold is the sum of threshold infinity the spike component
    of the threshold and the voltage component of the threshold.  Therefore threshold infinity and 
    the spike component of the threshold must be subtracted from the threshold of the neuron in order
    to isolate the voltage component of the threshold.  In the evaluation of the model the actual
    voltage of the neuron is used so that any errors in the other components of the model will not 
    influence the fits here (for example, if a afterspike current was estimated incorrectly)
  
    Notes:
    * The spike component of the threshold is subtracted from the 
        voltage which means that the voltage component of the threshold should only be added to rules.
    * b_spike was fit using a negative value in the function therefore the negative is placed in the 
        equation. 
    * values in this function are in 'real' voltage as opposed to voltage
        relative to resting potential. 
    * current injection during the spike is not taken into account.  This seems reasonable as the 
        ion channels are open during this time and injected current may not greatly influence the neuron.

#    component of the threshold obtained from the biological neuron and the voltage component 
#    of the threshold of the model obtained with the input parameters (so that the minimum can be

#    the spike component of the threshold must be subtracted from the threshold of the neuron in order
#    to isolate the voltage component of the threshold.  In the evaluation of the model the actual
#    voltage of the neuron is used so that any errors in the other components of the model will not 
#    influence the fits here (for example if a afterspike current was estimated incorrectly)
#  
#    Notes:
#    * The spike component of the threshold is subtracted from the 
#        voltage which means that the voltage component of the threshold should only be added to rules.
#    * b_spike was fit using a negative value in the function therefore the negative is placed in the 
#        equation. 
#    * values in this function are in 'real' voltage as opposed to voltage
#        relative to resting potential. 
#    * current injection during the spike is not taken into account.  This seems reasonable as the 
#        ion channels are open during this time and injected current may not greatly influence the neuron.
