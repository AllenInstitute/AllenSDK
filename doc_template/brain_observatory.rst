Brain Observatory
=================

The `Allen Brain Observatory <http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding>`_ is a database of the visually-evoked functional
responses of neurons in mouse visual cortex based on 2-photon fluorescence imaging.  Characterized responses include orientation 
tuning, spatial and temporal frequency tuning, temporal dynamics, and spatial receptive field structure. 

The data is organized into experiments and experiment containers.  An experiment container represents a group of 
experiments with the same targeted imaging area, imaging depth, and Cre line.  The individual experiments within 
an experiment container have different stimulus protocols, but cover the same imaging field of view.

Data Processing
---------------

For all data in Allen Brain Observatory, we perform the following processing:

   1. Segment cell masks from each experiment's 2-photon fluorescence video
   2. Associate cells from experiments belonging to the same experiment container and assign unique IDs
   3. Extract each cell's mean fluorescence trace
   4. Extract mean fluorescence traces from each cell's surrounding neuropil
   5. Estimate neuropil-corrected fluorescence traces
   6. Compute dF/F 
   7. Compute stimulus-specific tuning metrics 

All traces and masks for segmented cells in an experiment are stored in a Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) file.
Stored traces include the raw fluoresence trace, neuropil trace, and dF/F trace.  Code for extracting neuropil-corrected
fluorescence traces, computing dF/F, and computing tuning metrics is available in the SDK.  

For more information about data processing, please `read the technical whitepapers <http://help.brain-map.org/display/observatory/Documentation>`_.


Getting Started
---------------

The Brain Observatory `Jupyter notebook <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html>`_ has many code samples to help get
started with the available data:

    - `Download experimental metadata by visual area, imaging depth, and Cre line <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html#Experiment-Containers>`_
    - `Find cells with specific response properties, like direction tuning <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html#Find-Cells-of-Interest>`_
    - `Download data for an experiment <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html#Download-Experiment-Data-for-a-Cell>`_
    - `Plot raw fluorescences traces, neuropil-corrected traces, and dF/F <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html#Fluorescence-Traces>`_
    - `Find the ROI mask for a given cell <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html#ROI-Masks>`_    
    - `Run neuropil correction <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory.html#Neuropil-Correction>`_

The code used to analyze and visualize data in the `Allen Brain Observatory data portal <http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding>`_ 
is available as part of the SDK.  Take a look at this `Jupyter notebook <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory_analysis.html>`_ to find out how to:

    - `Plot cell's response to its preferred stimulus condition <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory_analysis.html#Drifting-Gratings>`_    
    - `Compute a cell's on/off receptive field based on the locally sparse noise stimulus <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory_analysis.html#Locally-Sparse-Noise>`_ 

More detailed documentation is available demonstrating how to: 

    - `Read and visualize the stimulus presentation tables in the NWB files <_static/examples/nb/brain_observatory_stimuli.html>`_
    - `Understand the layout of Brain Observatory NWB files <brain_observatory_nwb.html>`_
