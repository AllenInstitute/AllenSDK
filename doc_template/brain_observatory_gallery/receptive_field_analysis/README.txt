Brain Observatory Receptive Field Analysis
==========================================
This gallery demonstrates how to run the brain_observatory.receptive_field_analysis module. 
This module uses a cell's responses to the locally sparse noise stimulus to characterize the 
spatial receptive field, including on and off subunits. 

We highly recommend reading through the 
`stimulus analysis whitepaper <http://help.brain-map.org/display/observatory/Documentation>`_
to understand the locally sparse noise stimulus and the analysis methodology.
