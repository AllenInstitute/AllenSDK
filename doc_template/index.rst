The Allen Software Development Kit houses source code for reading and processing Allen Brain Atlas data.  
The Allen SDK focuses on the Allen Brain Observatory, Cell Types Database, and Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas.

.. ATTENTION::
    As of October 2019, we have dropped Python 2 support and any files with a py2 dependency (for example analysis files) have been updated.

Allen Brain Observatory
-----------------------

The Allen Brain Observatory is a collection of data resources for understanding sensory 
processing in the mouse visual cortex.  These resources systematically measure visual 
responses in multiple cortical areas and layers using two-photon calcium imaging or 
high-density extracellular electrophysiology (Neuropixels) probes.  Recordings are 
performed on mice passively viewing visual stimuli or trained to actively perform an 
image change detection task.

Experiment and stimulus data are provided in `Neurodata Without Borders <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ (NWB) files. 
The AllenSDK provides code to:

   * download and organize experiment data according to cortical area, imaging depth, and Cre line
   * access experiment metadata and data streams
   * transform and analyze data

More information about each study is provided in the linked pages. A web-based entry point to 
the Visual Coding – Optical physiology data is available at http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding .

Allen Cell Types Database
-------------------------

The `Allen Cell Types Database <http://celltypes.brain-map.org>`_ contains electrophysiological and morphological characterizations
of individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex.  The Allen SDK provides Python code
for accessing electrophysiology measurements (`NWB files <cell_types.html#neurodata-without-borders>`_) 
for all neurons and morphological reconstructions (`SWC files <cell_types.html#morphology-swc-files>`_) for a subset of neurons.

The Database also contains two classes of models fit to this data set: biophysical
models produced using the NEURON simulator and generalized leaky integrate and fire models (GLIFs) 
produced using custom Python code provided with this toolkit. 

The Allen SDK provides sample code 
demonstrating how to download neuronal model parameters from the Allen Brain Atlas API and run 
your own simulations using stimuli from the Allen Cell Types Database or custom current injections:

Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas
------------------------------------

The `Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas <http://connectivity.brain-map.org>`_ is a high-resolution map of neural connections in the mouse brain. Built on an array of transgenic mice genetically engineered to target specific cell types, the Atlas comprises a unique compendium of projections from selected neuronal populations throughout the brain.  The primary data of the Atlas consists of high-resolution images of axonal projections targeting different anatomic regions or various cell types using Cre-dependent specimens. Each data set is processed through an informatics data analysis pipeline to obtain spatially mapped quantified projection information.

The Allen SDK provides Python code for accessing experimental metadata along with projection signal volumes registered to a common coordinate framework.  This framework has structural annotations, which allows users to compute structure-level signal statistics.

See the `mouse connectivity section <connectivity.html>`_ for more details.

- CCF locations for ecephys neuropixels electrodes are now written to NWB files
- Examples for accessing eye tracking ellipse fit and screen gaze location data have been added to ecephys example notebooks

**Important Note**:
Due to newer versions of pynwb/hdmf having issues reading previously released Visual Coding Neuropixels NWB files and due to the significant reorganization of their NWB file contents, this release contains breaking changes that necessitate a major version revision. NWB files released prior to 6/11/2020 are not guaranteed to work with the 2.0.0 version of AllenSDK. If you cannot or choose not to re-download the updated NWB files, you can continue using a prior version of AllenSDK (< 2.0.0) to access them. However, no further features or bugfixes for AllenSDK (< 2.0.0) are planned. Data released for other projects (Cell Types, Mouse Connectivity, etc.) are *NOT* affected and will *NOT* need to be re-downloaded
