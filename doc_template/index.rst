The Allen Software Development Kit houses source code for reading and processing Allen Brain Atlas data.  
The Allen SDK focuses on the Allen Brain Observatory, Cell Types Database, and Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas.

Allen Brain Observatory
-----------------------

The `Allen Brain Observatory <http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding>`_ is a data resource for
understanding sensory processing in the mouse visual cortex.  This study systematically measures visual
responses in multiple cortical areas and layers using two-photon calcium imaging of GCaMP6-labeled neurons 
targeted using Cre driver lines.  Response characterizations include orientation tuning, spatial and temporal
frequency tuning, temporal dynamics, and spatial receptive field structure.
 
The mean fluorescence traces for all segmented cells are available in the Neurodata Without Borders file format 
(`NWB files <brain_observatory_nwb.html>`_).  These files contain standardized descriptions of visual stimuli to support stimulus-specific tuning analysis.  The Allen SDK provides code to:

   * download and organize experiment data according to cortical area, imaging depth, and Cre line
   * remove the contribution of neuropil signal from fluorescence traces
   * access (or compute) dF/F traces based on the neuropil-corrected traces
   * perform stimulus-specific tuning analysis (e.g. drifting grating direction tuning)

Allen Cell Types Database
-------------------------

The `Allen Cell Types Database <http://celltypes.brain-map.org>`_ contains electrophysiological and morphological characterizations
of individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex.  The Allen SDK provides Python code
for accessing electrophysiology measurements (`NWB files <cell_types.html#neurodata-without-borders>`_) 
for all neurons and morphological reconstructions (`SWC files <cell_types.html#morphology-swc-files>`_) for a subset of neurons.

The Database also contains two classes of models fit to this data set: biophysical
models produced using the NEURON simulator and generalized leaky integrate and fire models (GLIFs) 
produced using custom Python code provided with this toolkit. 

The Allen SDK provides sample code 
demonstrating how to download neuronal model parameters from the Allen Brain Atlas API and run 
your own simulations using stimuli from the Allen Cell Types Database or custom current injections:

Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas
------------------------------------

The `Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas <http://connectivity.brain-map.org>`_ is a high-resolution map of neural connections in the mouse brain. Built on an array of transgenic mice genetically engineered to target specific cell types, the Atlas comprises a unique compendium of projections from selected neuronal populations throughout the brain.  The primary data of the Atlas consists of high-resolution images of axonal projections targeting different anatomic regions or various cell types using Cre-dependent specimens. Each data set is processed through an informatics data analysis pipeline to obtain spatially mapped quantified projection information.

The Allen SDK provides Python code for accessing experimental metadata along with projection signal volumes registered to a common coordinate framework.  This framework has structural annotations, which allows users to compute structure-level signal statistics.

See the `mouse connectivity section <connectivity.html>`_ for more details.

What's New - Release 0.13.2 (June 15th, 2017)
----------------------------------------------

The 0.13.2 release is a major update for the Brain Observatory modules and data.  All Brain Observatory NWB files have been regenerated, and a large number of new experiments have been released.  All NWB files now contain demixed traces.  These traces are used for neuropil subtraction and dF/F computation, so those traces are affected as well.  

To get new lists of experiments and metadata, please delete/rename the directory container the Brain Observatory manifest.  The new files are a bit larger because of the new traces.

The cross-session alignment algorithm has been updated and re-run, so **all cell specimen IDs have changed**.  We have built a mapping table to help map from previous cell IDs to new cell IDs available here: `cell_specimen_mapping.csv <http://api.brain-map.org/api/v2/well_known_file_download/590985414>`_. For examples of how to download the file with the SDK and use it to map between IDs, see this `notebook <_static/examples/nb/cell_specimen_mapping.html>`_.

The cell specimens table now has a large number of new features.  Read the `technical whitepapers <http://help.brain-map.org/display/observatory/Documentation>`_ on stimulus analysis to learn more.

Code changes include:
    * a new receptive field analysis module (:py:mod:`~allensdk.brain_observatory.receptive_field_analysis`)
    * a trace demixing algorithm (:py:mod:`~allensdk.brain_observatory.demixer`)
    * a new convenience method: :py:meth:`~allensdk.core.brain_observatory_cache.BrainObservatoryCache.get_ophys_experiment_stimuli`
    * a new method to get the cell specimen mapping table: :py:meth:`~allensdk.api.queries.brain_observatory_api.BrainObservatoryApi.get_cell_specimen_id_mapping`
    * new methods :py:meth:`~allensdk.core.brain_observatory_nwb_data_set.BrainObservatoryNwbDataSet.get_pupil_location` and :py:meth:`~allensdk.core.brain_observatory_nwb_data_set.BrainObservatoryNwbDataSet.get_pupil_size` to get pupil position and size for experiments with eye tracking data.
    * :py:meth:`~allensdk.core.brain_observatory_cache.BrainObservatoryCache.get_ophys_experiments` accepts a list of ``cell_specimen_ids`` as an additional filter
    * :py:meth:`~allensdk.core.brain_observatory_cache.BrainObservatoryCache.get_ophys_experiments` returns "acquisition_age_days" instead of "age_days".  The new field describes the age of the animal on the day of experiment acquisition.
    * :py:meth:`~allensdk.core.brain_observatory_cache.BrainObservatoryCache.get_experiment_containers` no longer returns "age_days".
