Structure Unionize Records
--------------------------

All AAV Projection signal in the Allen Mouse Connectivity Atlas has been 
registered to the expert-annotated Common Coordinate Framework.  This enables 
signal quantification at all annotated levels of the brain structure ontology.  
In the AllenSDK and Allen Brain Atlas API we call structure-level signal 
integration "unionization".  

AAV unionize records are available for download directly through the API or via 
the MouseConnectivityCache.  The following methods return a Pandas DataFrame 
of records that describe projection signal in all structures in the adult
mouse ontology:

    :py:meth:`allensdk.core.mouse_connectivity_cache.MouseConnectivityCache.get_structure_unionizes`

    :py:meth:`allensdk.core.mouse_connectivity_cache.MouseConnectivityCache.get_experiment_structure_unionizes` 

Take a look at the Structure Signal Unionization section of the 
`Mouse Connectivity Jupyter notebook <_static/examples/nb/mouse_connectivity.html#Structure-Signal-Unionization>`_ to see how these methods can be used.


Record Properties
-----------------

============================== ==============================================================
Property                       Description
============================== ==============================================================
experiment_id                  ID of the experiment (a.k.a SectionDataSet)
structure_id                   ID of the structure (e.g. 315 for Isocortex)
hemisphere_id                  ID of the hemisphere (1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both)
is_injection                   If true, numbers only include voxels from injection site.  If false, numbers only include voxels outside of the injection site.
sum_pixels                     Number of valid pixels in the structure in this experiment.  Valid pixels are those not manually annotated as invalid data.
sum_projection_pixels          Number of pixels identified as projecting in this structure.
sum_pixel_intensity            Sum of intensity values in this structure.
sum_projection_pixel_intensity Sum of intensity values in projecting pixels in this structure.
projection_density             sum_projection_pixels / sum_pixels
projection_intensity           sum_projection_pixel_intensity / sum_projection_pixels
projection_energy              projection_density * projection_intensity
volume                         volume of valid pixels in structure. Valid pixels are those not manually annotated as invalid data.
projection_volume              volume of projection signal in structure in mm3
normalized_projection_volume   projection_volume / total volume of signal in brain
max_voxel_density              density of projection signal in 10um3 grid voxel with largest density.
max_voxel_x                    x coordinate in um of grid voxel with largest density.
max_voxel_y                    y coordinate in um of grid voxel with largest density.
max_voxel_z                    z coordinate in um of grid voxel with largest density.
