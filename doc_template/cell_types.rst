Cell Types
==========

The Allen Cell Types data set is a database of mouse and human neuronal cell types based on multimodal characterization
of single cells to enable data-driven approaches to classification and is fully integrated with other
Allen Brain Atlas resources.  The database currently includes:

    * **electrophysiology**: whole cell current clamp recordings made from Cre-positive neurons
    * **morphology**: 3D bright-field images of the complete structure of neurons from the visual cortex

This page describes how the SDK can be used to access data in the Cell Types Database.  For more information, 
please visit the Cell Types Database `home page <http://celltypes.brain-map.org/>`_ and the 
`API documentation <http://help.brain-map.org/display/celltypes/Allen+Cell+Types+Database>`_.


Examples
--------

The Cell Types `Jupyter notebook <_static/examples/nb/cell_types.html>`_ has many code samples to help get
started with analysis:

    - `Download and plot stimuli and responses from an NWB file for a cell <_static/examples/nb/cell_types.html#Cell-Types-Database>`_
    - `Download and plot a cell's morphological reconstruction <_static/examples/nb/cell_types.html#Cell-Morphology-Reconstructions>`_
    - `Download and plot precomputed electrophysiology features <_static/examples/nb/cell_types.html#Electrophysiology-Features>`_
    - `Download precomputed morphology features to a table <_static/examples/nb/cell_types.html#Morphology-Features>`_
    - `Compute electrophysiology features for a single sweep <_static/examples/nb/cell_types.html#Computing-Electrophysiology-Features>`_
      

Cell Types Cache
----------------

The :py:class:`~allensdk.api.queries.cell_types_api.CellTypesCache` class provides a Python interface for downloading data
in the Allen Cell Types Database into well known locations so that you don't have to think
about file names and directories.  The following example demonstrates how to download meta data for
all cells with 3D reconstructions, then download the reconstruction and electrophysiology recordings
for one of those cells:

.. literalinclude:: examples_root/examples/cell_types_ex.py    
    :lines: 5-16
    
:py:class:`~allensdk.api.queries.cell_types_api.CellTypesCache` takes takes care of knowing if you've already downloaded some files and reads
them from disk instead of downloading them again.  All data is stored in the same directory as the `manifest_file` argument to the constructor.


Feature Extraction
------------------

The :py:class:`~allensdk.ephys.feature_extraction.EphysFeatureExtractor` class calculates electrophysiology
features from cell recordings.  :py:func:`~allensdk.ephys.extract_cell_features.extract_cell_features` can
be used to extract the precise feature values available in the Cell Types Database:

.. literalinclude:: examples_root/examples/cell_types_ex.py
    :lines: 22-45


File Formats
------------

This section provides a short description of the file formats used for Allen Cell Types data.

Morphology SWC Files
++++++++++++++++++++

Morphological neuron reconstructions are available for download as SWC files.  The SWC file format is a white-space delimited text file with a standard set of headers.  The file lists a set of 3D neuronal compartments, each of which has:

====== ========= ===========================
Column Data Type Description
====== ========= ===========================
id     string    compartment ID
type   integer   compartment type
x      float     3D compartment position (x)
y      float     3D compartment position (y)
z      float     3D compartment position (z)
radius float     compartment radius
parent string    parent compartment ID
====== ========= ===========================

Comment lines begin with a '#'.  Reconstructions in the Allen Cell Types Database can contain the following compartment types:

==== ===============
Type Description
==== ===============
0    unknown
1    soma
2    axon
3    basal dendrite
4    apical dendrite
==== ===============

The Allen SDK comes with a :py:mod:`~allensdk.core.swc` Python module that provides helper functions and classes for manipulating SWC files.  Consider the following example:

.. literalinclude:: examples_root/examples/cell_types_ex.py    
    :lines: 51-72

Neurodata Without Borders
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The electrophysiology data collected in the Allen Cell Types Database 
is stored in the `Neurodata Without Borders`_ (NWB) file format.
This format, created as part of the `NWB initiative`_, is designed to store
a variety of neurophysiology data, including data from intra- and
extracellular electrophysiology experiments, optophysiology experiments,
as well as tracking and stimulus data.  It has a defined schema and metadata
labeling system designed so software tools can easily access contained data.

.. _NWB initiative: http://crcns.org/NWB/Overview

The Allen SDK provides a basic Python class for extracting data from 
Allen Cell Types Database NWB files. These files store data from intracellular 
patch-clamp recordings. A stimulus current is presented to the cell and the cell's 
voltage response is recorded.  The file stores both stimulus and response for
several experimental trials, here called "sweeps."  The following code snippet
demonstrates how to extract a sweep's stimulus, response, sampling rate, 
and estimated spike times:

.. literalinclude:: examples_root/examples/cell_types_ex.py
    :lines: 78-101

HDF5 Overview
+++++++++++++

NWB is implemented in HDF5_.  HDF5 files provide a hierarchical data storage that mirrors the organization of a file system.  Just as a file system has directories and files, and HDF5 file has groups and datasets.  The best way to understand an HDF5 (and NWB) file is to open a data file in an HDF5 browser. HDFView_ is the recommended browser from the makers of HDF5.  

There are HDF5 manipulation libraries for many languages and platorms.  MATLAB and Python in particular have strong HDF5 support.
