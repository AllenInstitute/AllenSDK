    "# Accessing Neuropixels Visual Coding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook covers the various methods for accessing the Allen Institute Neuropixels Visual Coding dataset. We will go over how to request data, where it's stored, and what the various files contain.  If you're having trouble downloading the data, or you just want to know more about what's going on under the hood, this is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we do not have a web interface for browsing through the available cells and experiments, as with the [two-photon imaging Visual Coding dataset](http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding). Instead, the data must be retrieved through the AllenSDK (Python 3.6+), or via requests sent to [api.brain-map.org](http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/api).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions related to data analysis will be covered in other tutorials. For a full list of available tutorials, see the [SDK documentation](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Options for data access\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`EcephysProjectCache` object of the AllenSDK** is the easiest way to interact with the data. This object abstracts away the details of on-disk file storage, and delivers the data to you as ready-to-analyze Python objects. The cache will automatically keep track of which files are stored locally, and will download additional files on an as-needed basis. Usually you won't need to worry about how these files are structured, but this tutorial will cover those details in case you want to analyze them without using the AllenSDK (e.g., in Matlab). This tutorial begins with <a href='#Using-the-AllenSDK-to-retrieve-data'>an introduction to this approach</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have an **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** account, you can use an `EcephysProjectCache` object to access the data via the Allen Brain Observatory Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This is an AWS Public Dataset located at `arn:aws:s3:::allen-brain-observatory` in region `us-west-2`. Launching a Jupyter notebook instance on AWS will allow you to access the complete dataset without having to download anything locally. This includes around 80 TB of raw data files, which are not accessible via the AllenSDK. The only drawback is that you'll need to pay for the time that your instance is running—but this can still be economical in many cases. A brief overview of this approach can be found <a href='#Accessing-data-on-AWS'>below</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third option is to directly download the data via **api.brain-map.org**. This should be used only as a last resort if the other options are broken or are not available to you. Instructions for this can be found <a href='#Direct-download-via-api.brain-map.org'>at the end of this tutorial</a>."

    "1. CSV files containing information about sessions, probes, channels and units (58.1 MB)\n",

    "\n",
    "Before downloading the data, you must decide where the `manifest.json` file lives. This file serves as the map that guides the `EcephysProjectCache` object to the file locations.\n",

    "When you initialize a local cache for the first time, it will create the manifest file at the path that you specify. This file lives in the same directory as the rest of the data, so make sure you put it somewhere that has enough space available. \n",

    "When you need to access the data in subsequent analysis sessions, you should point the `EcephysProjectCache` object to an _existing_ `manifest.json` file; otherwise, it will try to re-download the data in a new location.\n",

    "The `probes` DataFrame contains information about the Neuropixels probes used across all recordings. Each row represents one probe from one recording session, even though the physical probes may have been used in multiple sessions. Some of the important columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ecephys_session_id`: the index column of the `sessions` table\n",
    "- `sampling_rate`: the sampling rate (in Hz) for this probe's spike band; note that each probe has a unique sampling rate around 30 kHz. The small variations in sampling rate across probes can add up to large offsets over time, so it's critical to take these differences into account. However, all of the data you will interact with has been pre-aligned to a common clock, so this value is included only for reference purposes.\n",
    "- `lfp_sampling_rate`: the sampling rate (in Hz) for this probe's LFP band NWB files, after 2x downsampling from the original rate of 2.5 kHz\n",
    "- `name`: the probe name is assigned based on the location of the probe on the recording rig. This is useful to keep in mind because probes with the same name are always targeted to the same cortical region and enter the brain from the same angle (`probeA` = AM, `probeB` = PM, `probeC` = V1, `probeD` = LM, `probeE` = AL, `probeF` = RL). However, the targeting is not always accurate, so the actual recorded region may be different.\n",
    "- `phase`: the data may have been generated by one of two \"phases\" of Neuropixels probes. **3a** = prototype version; **PXI** = publicly available version (\"Neuropixels 1.0\"). The two phases should be equivalent from the perspective of data analysis, but there may be differences in the noise characteristics between the two acquisition systems.\n",
    "- `channel_count`: the number of channels with spikes or LFP data (maximum = 384)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `channels.csv` file contains information about each of these channels."
