    "Above, we can see that stimuli were being delivered at a regular cadence (250 ms on, 500 ms off). There were changes to new stimuli at t = 778.6 and t = 793.7, as indicated by the change in the color of the bars. The mouse licked inside of the required response window following both stimulus changes and received a reward coincident with the first lick following the change. The subsequent licks are likely a result of the mouse consuming the water reward. There was also a brief bout of two licks, likely representing impulsivity, at t = 786.9."
