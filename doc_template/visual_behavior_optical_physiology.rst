VISUAL BEHAVIOR OPTICAL PHYSIOLOGY DATASETS
--------------------------------------------

The Visual Behavior 2P project used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging (also 
called optical physiology, or “ophys”) to measure the activity 
of genetically identified neurons in the visual cortex of mice performing a 
go/no-go visual change detection task. This dataset can be used to evaluate the 
influence of experience, expectation, and task engagement on neural coding 
and dynamics in excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. A description of the 
experimental design and available data is provided below.  

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/visual_behavior_2p.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

We used single- and multi-plane imaging approaches to record the activity 
of populations of neurons across multiple cortical depths and visual areas 
during change detection behavior. Each population of neurons was imaged 
repeatedly over multiple days under different sensory and behavioral 
contexts, including familiar and novel stimuli, as well as active behavior 
and passive viewing conditions. 

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/experimental_design.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

Different imaging configurations and stimulus sets were used in different groups of mice, 
resulting in four unique datasets (indicated by their **project_code** in SDK metadata tables). 
Two single-plane 2-photon datasets were acquired in the primary visual cortex (VISp). 
In the `VisualBehavior` dataset, mice were trained with image set A and tested with image set B
which was novel to the mice. In the `VisualBehaviorTask1B` dataset, mice were trained with image set B
and tested with image set A as the novel image set. One multi-plane dataset (`VisualBehahviorMultiscope`) was acquired 
at 4 cortical depths in 2 visual areas (VISp & VISl) using image set A for training and image set B for novelty.
Another multi-plane dataset (`VisualBehaviorMultiscope4areasx2d`) was acquired at 2 cortical depths 
in 4 visual areas (VISp, VISl, VISal, VISam). In this dataset, two of the images that became highly familiar 
during training with image set G were interleaved among novel images in image set H.

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/dataset_variants_GH.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

For each dataset, we imaged the activity of GCaMP6 expressing cells in populations 
of excitatory (Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93(TITL-GCaMP6f) or Ai94(TITL-GCaMP6s)), 
Vip inhibitory (Vip-IRES-Cre;Ai148(TIT2L-GCaMP6f-ICL-tTA2)), 
and Sst inhibitory (Sst-IRES-Cre;Ai148(TIT2L-GCaMP6f-ICL-tTA2)) neurons. 
Imaging took place between 75-400um below the cortical surface. 

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/cre_lines.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

The full dataset includes neural and behavioral measurements from 107 
mice during 703 in vivo 2-photon imaging sessions from 326 unique fields of view,
resulting in longitudinal recordings from 50,476 cortical neurons.
The table below describes the numbers of mice, sessions, and unique recorded 
neurons for each transgenic line and experimental configuration:

BEHAVIORAL TRAINING
---------------------

Prior to 2-photon imaging, mice were trained to perform a go/no-go visual 
change detection task in which they learned to lick a spout in response to 
changes in stimulus identity to earn a water reward. The full 
behavioral training history of all imaged mice is provided as part of the dataset, 
allowing investigation into task learning, behavioral strategy, and inter-animal 
variability. There are a total of 4,787 behavior sessions available for analysis.

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/automated_training.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

We used a standardized procedure to progress mice through a series of 
training stages, with transitions between stages determined by specific 
advancement criteria. First, mice learned to detect changes in the 
orientation of full field static grating stimuli. Next, a 500ms inter 
stimulus interval period with mean luminance gray screen was added between 
the 250ms stimulus presentations, incorporating a short-term memory component 
to the task. Once mice successfully and consistently performed orientation 
change detection with flashed gratings, they moved to the image change 
detection version of the task. During image change detection, 8 natural scene 
images were presented during each behavioral session, for a total of 64 
possible image transitions. When behavioral performance again reached 
criterion (d-prime >1 for 2 out of 3 consecutive days), 
mice were transitioned to the 2-photon imaging stage in which they 
performed the task under a microscope to allow simultaneous measurement of 
neural activity and behavior. 

Behavioral training data for mice progressing through these 
stages of task learning is accessible via the **BehaviorSession** 
class of the AllenSDK or the :py:meth:`.get_behavior_session()` method of 
the **VisualBehaviorOphysProjectCache**. Each **BehaviorSession** 
contains the following data streams, event times, and metadata:

- Running speed
- Lick times
- Reward times
- Stimulus presentations
- Behavioral trial information
- Mouse metadata (age, sex, genotype, etc) 


2-PHOTON IMAGING DURING BEHAVIOR
---------------------------------

Once mice are well-trained on the image change detection task, 
they transition to performing the behavior under a 2-photon 
microscope. Each 2-photon field of view is imaged across multiple session types, 
allowing measurement of neural activity across 
different sensory and behavioral contexts. 

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/expt_design_notes.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

Mice initially perform the task under the microscope with the same set of 
images they observed during training, which have become highly familiar 
(each image is viewed thousands of times during training). Mice also 
undergo several sessions with a novel image set that they had not seen 
prior to the 2-photon imaging portion of the experiment. Passive viewing 
sessions are interleaved between active behavior sessions.
On passive days, mice are given their daily water before the session (and are thus satiated) 
and view the stimulus in open loop mode, with the lick spout retracted 
to indicate that rewards are not available. This allows investigation of the 
impact of motivation and attention on patterns of neural activity. 

During imaging sessions (but not during training), stimulus presentations are randomly 
omitted with a 5% probability, resulting in an extended gray screen period 
between two presentations of the same stimulus and disrupting the expected 
cadence of stimulus presentations. The change and pre-change stimulus presentations 
are never omitted. Running speed, pupil diameter, licking, and reward delivery
are measured and aligned to neural activity traces.

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/data_streams.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

The **BehaviorOphysExperiment** class in the AllenSDK (or the 
:py:meth:`.get_behavior_ophys_experiment()` method of the 
**VisualBehaviorOphysProjectCache**) provides all data for a 
single imaging plane, recorded in a single session, and contains 
the following data and metadata:

- Maximum intensity image
- Average intensity image
- Segmentation masks and ROI metadata
- dF/F traces (baseline corrected, normalized fluorescence traces)
- Corrected fluorescence traces (neuropil subtracted and demixed, but not normalized)
- Events (detected with an L0 event detection algorithm)
- Pupil position, diameter, and area
- Running speed (in cm/second)
- Lick times
- Reward times
- Stimulus presentation times	
- Behavioral trial information
- Mouse metadata (age, sex, genotype, etc) 

The data collected in a single continuous recording is defined as a 
**session** and receives a unique `ophys_session_id`. 
Each imaging plane in a given session is referred to as 
an **experiment** and receives a unique `ophys_experiment_id`. 
For single-plane imaging, there is only one 
imaging plane (i.e. one experiment) per session. For 
multi-plane imaging, there can be up to 8 imaging planes 
(i.e. 8 experiments) per session. Due to our strict QC process, described 
below, not all multi-plane imaging sessions have exactly 8 experiments, 
as some imaging planes may not meet our data quality criteria. 

.. image:: /_static/visual_behavior_2p/data_structure.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

We aimed to track the activity of single neurons across the session 
types described above by targeting the same population of neurons over 
multiple recording sessions, with only one session recorded per day 
for a given mouse. The collection of imaging sessions for a given 
population of cells, belonging to a single imaging plane measured 
across days, is called a **container** and receives a unique 
`ophys_container_id`. A container can include between 
3 and 11 separate sessions for that imaging plane. Mice imaged 
with the multi-plane 2-photon microscope can have multiple containers, 
one for each imaging plane recorded across multiple sessions. The session 
types available for a given container can vary, due to our selection 
criteria to ensure data quality (described below).

Thus, each mouse can have one or more **containers**, each representing a 
unique imaging plane (**experiment**) that has been targeted on 
multiple recording days (**sessions**), under different behavioral and 
sensory conditions (**session types**).

SESSION STRUCTURE
-----------------

During behavioral training, sessions consist of 60 minutes of change detection
behavior (other than the `TRAINING_0` sessions, which are 15 minutes of
associative reward pairing).

During ophys sessions (`session_type` starting with `OPHYS`), there is a 5
minute period where no stimulus is shown before the change detection task
begins, as well as 5 minutes of gray screen after the task ends. This allows
evaluation of spontaneous activity in the absence of stimulus or task. After
the second 5 minute gray screen period, a 30 second natural movie clip is
shown 10 times. This movie clip is the same as the Visual Coding 2P stimulus
called `natural_movie_one`. This allows evaluation of stimulus driven activity
that is independent of the task.

Ophys session structure:

   :width: 850


DATA PROCESSING
---------------

Each 2-photon movie is processed through a series of steps to 
obtain single cell traces of baseline-corrected fluorescence (dF/F) 
and detected events, and packaged into the NWB file format along with 
stimulus and behavioral information, as well as other metadata. 

Detailed descriptions of data processing steps can be found 
in the technical white paper, as well as our 
`data processing repository <https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ophys_etl_pipelines>`_.

   :align: center
   :width: 850


QUALITY CONTROL
---------------

Every 2-photon imaging session was carefully evaluated for a variety 
of quality control criteria to ensure that the final dataset is of 
the highest quality possible. Sessions or imaging planes that do not 
meet our criteria are excluded from the released dataset. These 
are a few of the key aspects of the data that are evaluated:

- intensity drift
- image saturation or bleaching
- z-drift over the course of a session
- accuracy of session-to-session field of view matching
- excessive or uncorrectable motion in the image
- uncorrectable crosstalk between simultaneously recorded multiscope planes
- errors affecting temporal alignment of data streams
- hardware or software failures
- brain health
- animal stress

  975358131, 1011688792
- The above identifiers have also been removed from their respective metadata
  tables. Columns such as prior_exposures however, are correctly calculated
  with knowledge of these sessions.
- The cell ROIs associated with the above experiments have also been removed
  from the cell ROI metadata table.
- Current data counts
    - 107 mice (same as v1.0.0)
    - 4079 behavior training session (down from 4082)
    - 703 in vivo 2-photon imaging sessions (down from 704 sessions,
      previous releases erroneously included session 875259383 in their
      metadata tables and claimed 705 sessions.)
    - 50,476 logitudinal recordings (down from 50,489)

Metadata Changes

- Additions to multiple tables
    - Added project_code and behavior_type (active/passive) value to all
      tables.
    - Added imaging_plane_group_count, num_depths_per_area,
      num_targeted_structures, experience_level to Behavior and Ophys session
      tables.
- Behavior session table
    - Added trials summary columns: catch_trial_count,
      correct_reject_trial_count, engaged_trial_count, false_alarm_trial_count,
      miss_trial_count, trial_count.
    - Added image_set column.
- Ophys experiment table
    - Added targeted_imaging_depth to experiment table, representing the
      average depth of all experiments in the published container.
- Better consistency of integer typing throughout.

NWB Data Changes

- The value for Age in the metadata, Session/Experiment objects now consistent.
  NWBs now reflect the age of the animal at the time the session/experiment was
  taken.
- Enforced better and more consistent typing between the metadata tables and
  the session metadata.
- All date/times in NWBs and metadata tables are now explicitly UTC timezone.
- Stimulus presentations tables now contain information for additional stimulus
  conditions, including 10 repeats of a 30 second movie clip at the end of
  session_types starting with OPHYS, and 5 minute gray screen period before and
  after change detection behavior in session_types starting with OPHYS. These
  new stimuli are delineated by stimulus_block and stimulus_block_name. The
  previously released image behavior stimulus is accessible as the block with a
  name containing "change_detection". Use the following example code snippet to
  retrieve the original stimulus block from the pandas table:
      stimulus_presentations[stimulus_presentations.stimulus_block_name.str.contains('change_detection')]
  See "SESSION STRUCTURE" section above for more details.
- New columns in the stimulus_presentations table:
    - is_image_novel, is_sham_change, movie_frame_index, movie_repeat,
      stimulus_block, stimulus_block_name, stimulus_name, active
    - See in code documentation for stimulus_presentations table for
      definitions of these new columns.
- New trials columns:
    - change_time, change_frame, response_latency
    - See in code documentation for trials table for definitions of these new
      columns.

Supplemental cache data

- New accessors in VisualBehaviorOphysProjectCache to download and cache the
  natural movie presented to the mice. Additional accessor to convert the movie
  to the format as shown on the screen during the session. (Warning this
  conversion is compute intensive). Methods are:
    - get_raw_natural_movie: Downloads the raw movie if needed and returns as
      an ndarray.
    - get_natural_movie_template: Converts the raw movie to the format as shown
      on the screen during the session. Return a pandas dataframe in a similar
      formate to the image templates. Warning this conversion is compute
      intensive.
